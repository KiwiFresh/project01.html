<article><p>Project 1 was a fun exercise with a number of challenges. The hardest part of the project for me was getting started. I spent a lot of time trying to figure out my layout and how I was going to set it up. Once I got going, I realized that my navigation bar was not working out horizontally. I tried changing its box sizing, and then I tried making a DIV for a good grid structure. However, the NAV just wasn’t centering or having good spacing. It just didn’t work. Instead of spending even more time trying to fix it, I decided to make the navigation bar vertical. It was very easy to make the change and I think the vertical bar looks a lot nicer. It doesn’t sit above the content, but rather on the side, while always being there when you need it.</p>

     <p>The most interesting thing about the project was the use of Code Pen. It was cool to make an animation and I learned how the tool works from this project. I tried changing some of the shapes, but they didn’t look as nice. I ended up keeping the same shapes while adding some of my favorite colors. I also appreciated the resources that were provided for this project via links. They definitely helped me with my work. I also checked W3schools for some things I was not sure about, like fixed NAV bar and hex colors.</p>

     <p>If I had to do this project over again, I would try to improve my CSS. Overall, I am pretty satisfied with it. I definitely applied more rules and more groupings than usual, but it could be better organized if I had more time. In addition, I would try to further improve the styling on my page. I made a simple design that looks good. However, the design would look better if I had some additional time to spend on improving the white spacing and fonts. Finally, CSS is usually the web design area where I spend most of my time. For this project, the html grid structure was my primary focus and the area where I spent most of my time.</p>

     <p>Overall, I enjoyed this project, and I learned a lot. I am also satisfied with the final product I created.</p>
